# Package and Present

> **When to consult:** After the skill is finalized, only if the `present_files` tool is available. Skip otherwise.

Check whether you have access to the `present_files` tool. If you don't, skip this step. If you do, package the skill and present the .skill file to the user:

```bash
python -m scripts.package_skill <path/to/skill-folder>
```

After packaging, direct the user to the resulting `.skill` file path so they can install it.
